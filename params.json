{"name":"Native","body":"# Native\r\n\r\nNative is a small collection of C++ libraries and utility code that I use for all my C++ Android projects (all two, yes). It's simply a way to get started quickly while having a lot of functionality. You can also compile it for Windows, Linux and Mac, and do cross platform development where you do all the coding and debugging on your PC and then deploy on Android.\r\n\r\nIt's not in any way a finished library, it's a codebase that grows as I need more features.\r\n\r\nCurrent interesting features:\r\n\r\n* OpenGL-accelerated 2D drawing library with atlas image support, for ultra-fast UIs and HUDs.\r\n* Utility functions to get started with GLSL shaders quickly\r\n* Loading and saving of ETC1 compressed textures\r\n* Audio effects mixer, with OGG sample loading support (not using the platform for that)\r\n* Very efficient JSON read/write\r\n* Cross platform logging that works with android logging\r\n* Section profiler\r\n\r\nUpcoming features (things I've done that I plan to move here):\r\n\r\n* A sample project\r\n* Android app framework (2.2 compatible)\r\n* Automatic atlas generator\r\n* Tool that uses the ETC1 functionality\r\n\r\nIt's intended to be very modular - you can simply not build any functionality you don't need by omitting the appropriate .cpp files from your build system.\r\n\r\nMostly under the MIT license, see Readme.md.","tagline":"A collection of useful C++ code that's tested to work on Android.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
